## Introduction  
Our project, **Predicting Tire Distance & Force**, is a smart mobility solution aimed at enhancing vehicle safety and performance. This idea leverages machine learning and real-time image processing to address critical challenges in tire wear prediction and force estimation during driving.  

---

## Problem Statement  
Tires are a critical component of vehicle safety. Over time, wear and tear can impact performance, cornering stability, and overall driving safety. Drivers often lack tools to proactively monitor tire health or anticipate forces acting on their tires.  

---

## Our Solution  
We propose a two-part solution that integrates machine learning and image analysis to provide actionable insights:

### Tire Lifespan Prediction:  
- Collect data on tire wear (mileage, pressure, driving conditions).  
- Train a machine learning model to predict tire replacement schedules.  
- Enable proactive maintenance to improve safety and extend tire life.  

### Force & Distance Estimation:  
- Use image processing to analyze road edge distances from real-time camera feeds.  
- Detect tire-road dynamics and estimate cornering forces to improve handling and performance.

## How We Built It  

### Machine Learning Model:  
- Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Trained the model with augmented tire condition data to achieve high accuracy.  
- **Output:** Predictions for tire health and replacement timelines.  

### Image Processing Module:  
- Built with OpenCV for edge detection and distance calculations.  
- Used algorithms like Canny Edge Detection and Hough Line Transform.  
- **Output:** Predicted cornering forces and distance metrics for real-time decision-making.  

---

## Results  
- **Model Accuracy:** Achieved 90%+ accuracy in predicting tire replacement schedules.  
- **Distance Detection:** Identified road edge distances with precision (e.g., 34 pixels).  
- **Force Estimation:** Predicted cornering forces with scalable calculations.

## Benefits  
- **Enhanced Safety:** Reduces accident risks by monitoring tire health.  
- **Improved Performance:** Optimizes cornering stability and vehicle handling.  
- **Sustainability:** Promotes efficient tire use, reducing waste.
